# Dutch Players Edit // esx_inventoryhud // ESX 1.2 ONLY
![welcome](https://www.gemeentenieuwstad.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/welcome.png)
Your number 1 inventory for ESX 1.2!

We have edited the original esx_inventoryhud resource from [Trsak](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-inventory-hud-2-4-properties-trunks-players-shops-storages/).

This inventory only works with the latest version of ESX. You can download v1-final here: https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended/tree/v1-final

Your help is much appreciated in a pull request!

We did not make any of these scripts. We do not take any credits. Did we forget to mention you in the credits? Then let us know in our Discord server or create an issue!
