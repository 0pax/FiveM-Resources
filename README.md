# Dutch Players Edit // esx-inventoryhud // SUPPORTED ESX 1.2 // IMPORTANT TO READ!
All working inventory hud which are taken offline
I did not make any of these scripts, i only edited a bit. I do not take any credits.

I uploaded this because multiple ESX inventory huds are taken offline.
Somewere i try updating this, but i am an amateur. Please do pull requests if you know better!

Currently this is working (somehow) on our 64 players ESX 1.2 OneSync server, but we do have an issue:
- Users can stack their items unlimited. I needed to update most of other resources to check weight/limit.
