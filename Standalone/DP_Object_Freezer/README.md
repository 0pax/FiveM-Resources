# Dutch Players Object Freezer
With this resource you can freeze specified objects if you are near them.

You do not need this resource if you use [Dutch Traffic Lights](https://github.com/dutchplayers/FiveM-Resources/tree/master/Standalone/DP_TeamMOH_Traffic_Lights)

The C# edition does not include a config file, but with the source folder you are able to build the .dll yourself in Visual Studio 2019. Editing the file is really easy in here.
To use the LUA version (with config.lua) you need to edit the fxmanifest.lua. Examples are already inside this file.
