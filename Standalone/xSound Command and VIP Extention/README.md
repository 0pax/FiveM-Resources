With this resource you can use youtube or MP3 to play audio with a dynamic (moving) position. Like a car radio were you can hear the audio outside the car and if the car moves, the audio also moves. You can now listed to your favorite music, everywhere in FiveM. 

You can change all commands in the config.lua.
If you start the radio in the car, the radio will follow the car.
If you start the radio outside the car, the radio will follow you.

If you set UseESX to true in the config.lua then your users will need the item specified in the config to play music outisde a vehicle.

If you set UseVIP to true in the config.lua then you need [PXRP_VIP](https://github.com/dutchplayers/pxrp_vip). Then a player can only use the commands if they are a VIP.
