# Dutch Players Edit // esx-inventoryhud // Glovebox Support
Esx_inventoryhud 2.3 was taken offline a while ago and would not be updated anymore. ESX has now also been updated (version 1.2), but now esx_inventoryhud 2.3 has become unusable.

We, Dutch Players, are still very much in favor of updating FiveM Artifacts and ESX. Both DISC inventoryhud and other UI oriented inventory systems have become unusable. Nevertheless, we would like a working UI for the inventory.

We are going to try to update esx_inventoryhud without bugs.
Your help is much appreciated in a pull request!

We did not make any of these scripts. We do not take any credits.
